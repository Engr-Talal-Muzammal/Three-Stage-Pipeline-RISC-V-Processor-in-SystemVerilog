# Three-Stage-Pipeline-RISC-V-Processor-in-SystemVerilog
This GitHub repository is home to a three-stage pipeline RISC-V processor. The processor is adept at managing control and data hazards and includes CSR read/write capabilities and a hazard detection unit. The implementation is in SystemVerilog, using ModelSim and GTKWave as the primary tools for simulation and waveform analysis.
